Patches
=======

This package occasionally uses cdbs simple-patch-system to store
modifications to the upstream source, although in most uploads no patches
are needed.

To get the fully patched source: make -f debian/rules patch

To revert to what's in git: make -f debian/rules unpatch

To add a patch: obtain a diff and put it in debian/patches, or see below

To remove an existing patch: delete it from debian/patches

Packaging using git
===================

The repository contains an appropriate debian/gbp.conf to build this package
using git-buildpackage. The debian branch contains the latest upstream versions
(for unstable, or experimental while a freeze is in progress). The debian-lenny
branch contains versions targeted for lenny, etc.

Here's how to build it:

    git clone git://git.debian.org/git/pkg-telepathy/ofono
    cd ofono
    git checkout debian
    git-buildpackage -us -uc

or for testing/stable branches like debian-lenny:

    git clone git://git.debian.org/git/pkg-telepathy/ofono
    cd ofono
    git checkout debian-lenny
    git-buildpackage -us -uc --git-debian-branch=debian-lenny

The branch 'upstream' is a copy of the contents of upstream tarballs. To import
upstream tarballs use:

    git checkout debian
    git-import-orig ~/ofono-0.x.tar.gz

The branch 'debian-patches' is 'upstream' plus any patches needed for Debian.
It should be rebased on 'upstream' after each upstream release:

    git checkout debian-patches
    git rebase upstream

The preferred way of adding patches is to cherry pick from an upstream
repository:

    git remote add ofono-upstream \
        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/ofono/ofono.git
    git fetch
    git checkout debian-patches
    git cherry-pick xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    git checkout debian
    fakeroot debian/rules update-patches
